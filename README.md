# RollerMadness
This is the repo for my Roller Ball game, built in Unity 5. This was the first game I ever built in Unity, and it was a project for the "Introduction to Video Game Development" course from Michigan State University through Coursera.

Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to try to collect as many coins as possible!

## Features/Challenges
* Tail Rendering
* Enemies with simple chase behavior
* UI (score, menus)
* Collisions and rigidbody physics

Hope you enjoy! Check out the Builds folder to download versions for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
